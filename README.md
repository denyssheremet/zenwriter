The best way to write something good is to just start writing and edit it later.
This app is specifically built to help you write down the first thing that comes to mind without filtering it. 

## Keep typing
The goal is to keep typing no matter what, even if you don't have anything to say. 
Once you start writing, your score will increase for every word that you have written. But in order to get a lot of points, you will need to keep on writing, because as soon as that you stop for longer than one second, your score will be reset.

## No backspace
The backspace button does not do anything. Producing letters is the best way to get better at writing and spelling mistakes can always be corrected later. 

## Why bother?
Writer's block is quite common amongst people that want to write something. You probably know this all too well. As Steven Pressfield says in The War of Art, you just need to sit down and write. Sitting down and writing is exactly what this app is for. The first draft is not about quality. It is about sitting down and writing.

## Try it out!

Try it out if you are interested! I am very interested in whether you felt a noticable improvement in the way you write. Please let me know. I also recommend to have very low expectations for the first time you will write like this. For me it was difficult to make even one sentence that made sense and did not contain a myriad of spelling errors.
